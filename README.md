# Advent of code 2022

My first time attempting the advent of code challenges!

I wanted to finish all the excercises in Haskell but since I was doing these puzzles in the morning before work, I switched to JavaScript whenever I couldn't come up with the Haskell solution. I know, it's sad...

I've only been doing Haskell for a month at the moment. I need to boost my skills in the language for next year.

## Progress

*Haskell:* 1,2,3,4,6,8
*JavaScript:* 5,7
*TypeScript:* 9,10,11,12,13,14
